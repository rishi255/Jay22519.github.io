## Problem Statement 
Creating an automatic answer checker web application for students and teachers, for grading of the answers submitted by students against an ideal solution uploaded by the teacher. 

### Rough outline  
- Students upload their hand-written answer sheets which will be converted to text.
- The solution provided by the students will be automatically marked against the ideal/correct answer given by the evaluator/professor, using AI to check similarity of the two answers 
- After evaluation the evaluator/professor can verify the marks and can also overwrite the marks awarded by the system.  
  
### Tech Stack  
1) Web application will be deployed using Django  
2) Image and Language processing will be done using Python Deep Learning APIs  
3) Database to use -> {to be decided}  
4) Frontend application and designing -> {to be decided}
