## Problem Statement 
Creating an automatic answer checker web application for students and teachers, for grading of the answers submitted by students against an ideal solution uploaded by the teacher. 

### Rough outline  
Students can upload their hand-written answer sheets which will be converted to text and will be automatically marked against the ideal/correct answer given by the evaluator/professor. After evaluation the evaluator/professor can verify the marks and can also overwrite the marks awarded by the system.  

### Tech Stack 
1) Web application will be deployed using Django  
2) Image and Language processing will be done using Python DL APIs  
3) Database to use -> {to be decided}  
4) Fronted application and designing -> {to be decided}
Further things to be added ...
